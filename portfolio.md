problem_solved: |
  Conservation researchers in western Mexico face an asymmetry: deep scientific
  expertise but limited reach. Their work covers a fraction of Jalisco's 80,000+ km²
  territory. BioJalisco proposes closing that gap through citizen science and technology,
  but the vision needed a compelling presentation to win stakeholders and partners.

  - "Self-contained single-file HTML site with 9 embedded images (~1.8MB total)"
  - "Bilingual ES/EN with instant language switching"
  - "Cinematic 5-act narrative arc designed for stakeholder persuasion"
  - "Procedural ambient forest audio via Web Audio API — no audio files"
  - "Deployed on Vercel with zero build step"

## Overview

BioJalisco is a proposed citizen-science biodiversity monitoring platform for western Mexico. Before building the platform, the project needed a persuasion artifact — a site that communicates the vision with enough emotional and intellectual weight to win over academic partners, conservation organizations, and potential funders.

This scrollytelling site is that artifact. Built as a single self-contained HTML file, it uses a cinematic 5-act story arc (Hook → Problem → Vision → Evidence → Ask) with scroll-triggered animations, parallax photography, ambient forest audio, and bilingual content to make the case for BioJalisco.

Every image is embedded as a base64 data URI, making the site fully portable — it works offline, deploys anywhere, and has zero external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

## The Challenge

- **The reach problem:** Verónica Rosas-Espinoza has deep expertise in Jalisco's biodiversity, but traditional ecology covers only ~5% of the territory systematically. The pitch needed to make this gap visceral, not abstract.
- **Dual audience:** The site must work for Spanish-speaking Mexican academics and English-speaking international partners — not as separate pages, but as a seamless bilingual experience.
- **Persuasion, not information:** This isn't a documentation site. It's a narrative designed to move people from awareness to action. Every section must earn its scroll.
- **Zero infrastructure:** The site needed to deploy instantly with no build step, no CMS, no backend — just drop a file on Vercel.

## The Solution

**Cinematic narrative structure:**
A 5-act story arc modeled on screenwriting principles. The hero section poses a provocative question, the problem section makes the data crisis tangible with animated counters, the vision section introduces BioJalisco as the answer, the evidence section builds credibility with a roadmap and proof points (iNaturalist precedent, book trilogy, team credentials), and the closing ask creates urgency.

**Bilingual architecture:**
A `data-lang` attribute on the body element combined with `.lang-es` / `.lang-en` CSS classes enables instant language switching with zero page reload. All content exists in both languages in the DOM — CSS toggles visibility.

**Self-contained deployment:**
All 9 images converted from PNG to WebP (88-95% size reduction), then embedded as base64 data URIs. The entire site is a single 1.8MB HTML file with no external asset dependencies.

**Procedural audio:**
The ambient forest soundscape is generated in real-time using Web Audio API — layered noise filters for wind, oscillators for bird chirps, and a low drone for depth. No audio files needed.

## Technical Highlights

- **Base64 image pipeline:** Python/Pillow batch conversion from PNG to optimized WebP, then base64 encoding — reduced total image payload from 16.8MB to 1.3MB (92% reduction)
- **Intersection Observer scroll system:** Multiple reveal classes (translate-Y, translate-X, scale) with staggered delays create a choreographed scroll experience without a single animation library
- **Web Audio API synthesis:** Three-layer procedural soundscape (filtered noise for wind, frequency-modulated oscillators for bird chirps, sine drone for depth) with fade-in/fade-out on toggle
- **CSS-only parallax:** `background-attachment: fixed` on the vision section creates depth without JavaScript scroll listeners
- **Animated counters:** Eased counter animations triggered by IntersectionObserver with cubic easing for natural deceleration

## Results

**For the Stakeholder Audience:**
- Complete narrative pitch accessible in both Spanish and English
- Credibility elements (PhD photo, book trilogy, fieldwork photography) embedded directly
- Single URL to share — no login, no app install, works on any device

**Technical Demonstration:**
- Proves that a high-impact persuasion site doesn't need React, a build system, or a CMS
- Shows restraint in technology choices — vanilla JS for a project that genuinely doesn't need frameworks
- Image optimization pipeline that could be reused across CushLabs projects
